## Latest Request (COMPLETED)

**Three capture-editor bug fixes: quote tilt no longer re-rolls, bold/italic/highlight formatting survives typing, torn-paper corners no longer clip the text**

### What was asked

1. The tilt that shows during entry addition (quote cards) keeps changing every time — save it so it doesn't change.
2. The bold text format shows when applied or while typing, but moments later it's gone — formatting isn't surviving/staying.
3. The corner of the paper text box is cutting off the beginning text.

### What was changed

**Tilt persistence — `CaptureData.kt` + `MarginaliaFormat.kt` + `EntryDetailScreen.kt`**
- `CaptureData.Marginalia` gained `quoteTilts: List<Float> = emptyList()` — the hand-placed angle per quote card, generated ONCE at card creation and saved with the entry. Legacy entries omit it (Gson → empty), callers fall back to a stable per-index random tilt.
- `MarginaliaFormat` — `quoteTilts` mutableStateListOf seeded from `initialData` and padded parallel to quotes; each card reads `quoteTilts.getOrElse(i)`; Remove deletes the tilt; "+ Add quote" adds a fresh one; `quoteTilts.toList()` is a `LaunchedEffect` key so saved tilts persist. `randomTilt()` helper defined AFTER the import block (was briefly inserted mid-imports — a compile error — fixed before commit).
- `EntryDetailScreen.MarginaliaRender` — quote pairs carry their ORIGINAL index through the blank filter, and rotation reads `data.quoteTilts.orEmpty().getOrNull(origIndex) ?: remember(origIndex) { random }` — saved angle wins, legacy entries get a stable-per-card fallback.

**Formatting survival — `RichTextEditor.kt`**
- Root cause: `emit()` trusted the AnnotatedString BasicTextField reports back, which can silently drop styles we set programmatically — so bold/italic/highlight vanished moments after applying.
- Fix: rebase OUR OWN tracked spans across each edit (`rebaseSpans(oldText, newText, ...)` — common-prefix/suffix diff, spans before the change keep offsets, after shift by delta, overlapping clip to untouched parts), then emulate caret inheritance from our own spans at the diff start (`sp.start <= caret && caret <= sp.end`, inclusive at span END so typing right after a styled word continues it). The field's reported AnnotatedString is no longer merged in.
- `insertedRange` (findInsertedRange) computed ONCE and shared by the caret-inheritance block and the sticky pending-format block.

**Torn corner clipping — `PaperCard.kt`**
- `TornPaperShape` amplitudes kept modest (2.5dp bite + 1.5dp tear ≈ 4dp worst-case inward) so the ragged edge never reaches the text.
- `TornPaperCard` floors the content inset: `maxOf(horizontal, 14.dp)` / `maxOf(vertical, 12.dp)` so even the tight 10dp quote-card padding can't let a tear clip the first characters near the top-left corner.

### Review
code-reviewer-deepseek-flash: clean pass (two rounds). Verified no declarations between imports, `calculateLeftPadding`/`calculateTopPadding` resolve as PaddingValues member functions (no import needed), inclusive-end caret inheritance is correct half-open math with no out-of-bounds spans, `remember(origIndex)` is a valid composable call inside the inline forEachIndexed, and no @Composable calls leak into non-composable lambdas. Both review notes (hoist insertedRange, inclusive span-end inheritance) applied.

### Follow-ups / notes
- Next per user: note-paper COLORS (new palette per style) — the `NotePaperStyle` field is already persisted, so a color companion is a clean follow-up.
- NO local Gradle build (per AGENTS.md) — CI validates compilation on push.
