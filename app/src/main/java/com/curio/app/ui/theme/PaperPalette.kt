 * Paper palette for the quotes entry (Marginalia journal + quote cards) and

 * a "note paper" look instead of the category tint:
 *
 * The paper text boxes are NOT theme-aware: they wear the same warm cream
 * paper (with its dark ink, faint ruled lines, amber highlighter, and soft
 * hairline edge) in BOTH light and dark mode, so a note reads as a physical
 * slip of paper regardless of the app theme.
 *
 * The highlighter marker is a translucent amber that reads on the cream
 * paper.

// its OWN matching marker tone (amber on cream, rose on pink, mint green on
// mint...) so a colored note's highlight reads as a marker that belongs to
// that page; [notePaperRule] and [notePaperBorder] derive the ruled lines
// and hairline edge from the sheet so each color stays coherent. All are
// theme-agnostic — the paper is the same in both modes, whatever the swatch.
