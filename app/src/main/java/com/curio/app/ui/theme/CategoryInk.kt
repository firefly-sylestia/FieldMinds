 * old cream-blended recipe let cream's warm hue dominate, so cool accents
 * drifted off-family (teal/sky pages washed grey-GREEN and the detail hero's
 * glide swung through green/yellow); the on-hue tint keeps the page AND the
 * hero's fade-into-it exactly on the category's color story. The pastel is
 * strong enough to READ (0.32/0.85 — see [lightAccentTint]) so a red page, a
 * teal page and a sky page are visibly different and the hero's blend ends
 * on the real category color, never a near-white beige.
 *
 * Dark mode: the deep Tailwind-700 accent alone at 20% reads muddy (amber
 * goes brown, teal goes grey-green), while its light 300-level twin at any
 * useful fraction reads WHITE-WASHED over the midnight surface. So this
 * builds a saturated mid-tone — the accent lerped partway toward its light
 * twin (≈ the 500-level shade) — and washes it at a moderate fraction. The
 * page keeps the category's hue with real color, never a washed-out grey-white.
 *
 * A few families need extra contrast: at the default 50% midpoint, rose
 * (movies), sky (science), amber (books — brown) and especially coral
 * (wildcard — its accent is already a pastel pink) read too
 * pale/white-washed. Those pull the mid-tone closer to the deep accent
 * (or a deep hue twin, for pale accents) and blend a touch stronger, so
 * the hue survives over midnight instead of flattening to grey-white.
